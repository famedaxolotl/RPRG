Plots contain: a) data (the information to be visualized) and b) a mapping which describes how the data variables are 'mapped' (linked) to graphs, charts and other visual attributes.

In mapping:
1. **Layers**: which has geometric elements (**geom**s) and statistical transformations (**stat**s) such as binning and counting observations to create a histogram, or fitting a linear model.
2. Scale maps values from the data to the aesthetic space using colours, shapes and sizes.
3. **coord**, which is the coordinate system used in plots
4.
